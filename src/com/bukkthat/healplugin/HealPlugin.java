public class HealPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    /* This is the method invoked when a command that we've registered in our plugin.yml
     * is typed by a Player, or the console.
     * <p>
     * The first parameter, the CommandSender, is the person who typed the command.
     * This person could be the console, or it could be a Player.  We should always
     * make sure that the sender is a Player before we cast to a Player.
     * <p>
     * The second parameter, the Command, is the command that they used.  The Command
     * can be used to determine the command that they typed by using Command#getName().
     * In our case, since our Command variable is called cmd, our method invocation would
     * look like cmd.getName().  You can compare the name using String's #equalIgnoreCase
     * to see if they typed a specific command.  We don't do that in this example because
     * we only have one command registered, so there's no need to check the name.
     * <p>
     * The third parameter, the String that we call the label, is the word that the user
     * literally typed to use our command.  If the server is using Bukkit aliasing it is
     * possible for this word to not be our command, so it should only be used when giving
     * a response to the user.  In other words, instead of telling them to type "/heal", we
     * should tell them to type "/"+label as to respect whatever bukkit.yml aliases that the
     * server owner has set up.
     * <p>
     * The fourth parameter, the String array, is any words that they typed after the command,
     * separated by spaces.  That means if they typed "/heal a lot of people", the String array
     * would contain "a", "lot", "of", "people".  To combine the words into a single String we
     * can use org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils.join with the appropriate arguments.
     * <p>
     * The return value determines whether or not the usage message that we put in our plugin.yml
     * is displayed to the user.  If we return true then the message isn't shown.  If we
     * return false then the usage message is sent to the CommandSender.
